# Open Grant Proposal


* **Project:** Polkadot Comics: visual explainers and Polkadot blockchain promotion in social media
* **Proposer:** @PolkadotComics
* **Payment Address:** 1PPpV6Dvd7ppjYttkJRXTBFxfQsnrF2Q1R  



## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

  * A brief description of the project.

This proposal aims to recommend strategies to create Polkadot tutorials and promote it in social media. The unique format will help to attract more new potential users to the Polkadot ecosystem, help educate newcomers, enlarge the Polkadot audience, and keep all community members up to date with all news and all education materials in the Polkadot ecosystem. 

  * An indication of why this project is good for the ecosystem.

A strong community is indispensable for a healthy digital system. Some even say it is the most important characteristic. However, the web is a big place. With so many different platforms and media, it can be hard to keep up with the latest Polkadot news. This proposal centers on publications one visual tutorial (Polkadot Comic) every two weeks. Every comic translates or explains the Polkadot ’s technical documentation, developments, news, and other to a compelling visual narrative. We think comics that can be adapted to multiple formats, even animated scenes or fully animated videos could provide the perfect channel to reach a broader audience, the younger generation and those who prefer visual information platforms such as YouTube or Instagram over text-based ones like Medium and Twitter where the Polkadot community has already doubled up its presence.


  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot.

As all comics have a specific format - large pictures with text - we will create a website where all users will be able to look at all comics in a big resolution. The web site will be in Polkadot`s style and to keep users on the site longer we will add tutorials and more information about Polkadot blockchain and all information related Web3 Foundation. Developers are doing amazing work and creating new exciting solutions. But there’s much more to be done and this means more coding hands are always desired. To bring more people into the project, we need to reach further.


  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

First of all, it is very interesting and brings a lot of fun. Creating something new is always great, and in parallel, we will be able to explain something difficult in a simple way.
We believe in the better Internet. The Internet where we don’t need to worry about our personal security and data security as well. We believe that this is highly likely to come true with such technology as Polkadot. If we start work on this now in the future we will live in the world of secure networks where individuals control their personal data and even derive income from it.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

Between weekly comics publications, we plan to publish a variety of information directly related to the Polkadot blockchain, you can find an example of such posts on our Twitter account - https://twitter.com/PolkadotComics 
Our first comic collected more than 25 000 impressions on Twitter, more than 550 profile visits, and 68 followers without any promotion.

Twitter Analytics - https://prnt.sc/s7d8i2

According to the latest stats published by the Pew Research Center about social media usage, Facebook (69%) and YouTube (73%) are the most widely used online platforms among U.S. adults. Instagram is used by 37% but has shown the most growth in the last 3 years. Twitter is lagging behind with just 22% and has declined since 2018. Among 18-to-24-year-old Instagram’s popularity has reached 75% and YouTube is leading the way with 90%. Twitter usage among this age group is at 44%.

The audience that is interested in the blockchain on Facebook is less, so we will not get hung up on Facebook
Social media presence on Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and most messaging platforms is a must. This Proposal and its derivatives present an opportunity to widen the Polkadot`s reach and show how visual communication can help explain cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology and how decentralized governance works.

Twitter: the best way to catch new users - run targeted ads, and choose audiences with special keywords. Expect this media posts should include unique media to encourage the community. Video, high-quality illustration, etc.

Instagram: targeted ads in stories, more fun and more interaction users in such great tools like Instagram stories. High-quality illustration. Connection Polkadot brand to such a unique Instagram feature as AR Masks - https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/ 

Telegram: The best solution is: long discussions and reposts of important news
